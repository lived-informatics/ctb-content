About us page community toolbox
Welcome to the Community Toolbox Project, an initiative that seeks to empower communities by providing access to innovative technology free of charge, enabling them to collect valuable data about their environment, well-being, and community dynamics.

The Community Toolbox is run by the [Internet of Caring Things](https://ioct.uknica.co.uk/) program, a program part of the [National Innovation Centre for Ageing](https://uknica.co.uk/) and founded by the North of Tyne Combined Authority. The Community Toolbox project  is based on the inspiring SenseMyStreet Sensor Commissioning toolkit which was originally developed in collaboration between [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/) and [Urban Observatory](http://www.urbanobservatory.ac.uk/) at Newcastle University.


## Our Vision

At the heart of the Community Toolbox Project is the vision of creating a connected and caring community. By bridging the gap between technology and the public, we aim to foster a sense of unity and empower individuals to actively contribute to the well-being of their community.

## Our Objectives

-	**Free Access to Technology:** We believe in democratising technology. Our objective is to offer the public the opportunity to experience innovative devices free of charge, fostering a culture of inclusivity and exploration.
-	**Data for Community Improvement:** Through the deployment of innovative technology, we seek to gather valuable data that can drive positive change within the community. The Community Toolbox serves as a platform for citizens to actively participate in data collection for the improvement of their surroundings.
-	**Transparent Reporting:** Our commitment to transparency is reflected in the clear and comprehensive reports generated from the gathered data. These reports provide insights into various aspects of the community, influencing informed decision-making for community development.
