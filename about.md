Welcome to the Community Toolbox Project, an initiative that seeks to empower communities by providing access to innovative technology free of charge, enabling them to collect valuable data about their environment, well-being, and community dynamics. 

The Community Toolbox is being delivered by the Internet of Caring Things programme (part of the National Innovation Centre for Ageing) with funding from the North of Tyne Combined Authority. It is inspired by and builds on the successful ‘SenseMyStreet’ Sensor Commissioning toolkit created by Open Lab and Urban Observatory at Newcastle University.  

**Our vision** 

We want to bridge the gap between technology and the public by giving free access to the latest technologies (tools) that support the things we care about and that care for us. Our vision is to create a connected and caring community where individuals and groups can explore, discover, and have fun with the tools, but also learn more about themselves, their communities, and the world around them through the data that is collected.    

**Our Objectives**  

Democratising Technology, by providing opportunities for the public to  experience innovative devices free of charge, fostering a culture of inclusivity and exploration. 

Demonstrate that data can support individuals and communities: by deploying innovative technology, together we can gather valuable data to help drive positive change for ourselves  and our communities.  The Community Toolbox serves as a platform for citizens to actively participate in data collection for community wellbeing. 

Transparent Reporting: Our commitment to transparency is reflected in the clear and comprehensive reports generated from the gathered data. These reports provide insights into various aspects of the community, influencing informed decision-making for community development.
