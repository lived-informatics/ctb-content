**Community Tool Box website leverages [Ideaboard](https://github.com/edjenkins/ideaboard) platform, an online collaboration tool developed at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/), Newcastle University as a research project. It also integrates SenseMyStreet Sensor Commissioning toolkit which was originally developed in collaboration between Open Lab and [Urban Observatory](http://www.urbanobservatory.ac.uk/) at Newcastle University.**

Community Tool Box is a new way of involving your friends/community/colleagues in shaping your latest idea. More than just a feedback tool, Community Tool Box is a collaborative space to develop any community imitative.

Getting started on Community Tool Box is easy, with a few clicks you can launch an idea page and start inviting people to subscribe and collaborate.

Start the conversation straight away in the general discussion, then you and your community can add 'tasks' such as polls and discussions to help shape your idea.

You can post regular updates to keep everyone notified, and use our custom planning tools to organise your idea.

## But that's not all?

With the integration of SenseMyStreet sensor commissioning toolkit, you can borrow different tools form the tool box to help you in our exploration.

## What makes Community Tool Box different?

Unlike other platforms, Community Tool Box is designed with community at its heart. We believe that any idea can be improved by including more passionate voices. Thatâ€™s why all our tools are open for everyone to use.

On Community Tool Box, anyone who subscribes to your idea can ask questions, set polls and offer their expertise! So much better than a survey, this is genuine, real collaboration between you and your audience.

## So what are you waiting for?
